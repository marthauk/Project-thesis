\textbf{Assignment title:} Miniature camera on Disruptive Technologies sensor
\\
\\
\textbf{ Assignment text: }
New extremely miniaturized cameras have become available the last years. One example is the NanEye (http:\/\/www.cmosis.com/products/product\_detail/naneye). Implementing such solutions in a DT wireless sensor may be extremely interesting. The power dissipation limitations would be a challenge to overcome, and innovative techniques should be assessed to find practical implementations.



The assignment is to:

- Find alternatives for miniaturized camera modules


Assess use cases for a camera used at a very low duty cycle


Estimate achievable power dissipation


Propose implementation strategy


The task is well suited to be continued in a master assignment.
